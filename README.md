# JEdit: The line editor in J
## Yes, I know that line editors are dead, but come on, I want to see if I can make it 8 lines!
I plan for these features:
* Append
* Save (Write)
* Open (Read)
* Edit line
* Print line
* List all lines
I plan to use tacit programming and see if I can compress it into 8 lines.
